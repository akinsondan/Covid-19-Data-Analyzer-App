Numpy: pip install numpy
Pandas: pip install pandas

The project folder can be opened on the PyCharm containing the following files;
•	main.py: main Python file where the app can be run from.
•	app_framework.py: This Python file contains the app framework code (functionality of the app).
•	cleaning.py: Contains the data cleaning code for cleaned_covid19_data.csv
•	data_analyzer_gui2.ui: The graphical user interface design file.
•	cleaned_covid19_data.csv: Cleaned data set.
•	COVID-19_Cases_World.csv: Original data set.
•	mplwidget.py: Python file for the Matplotlib library widget used in plotting.
•	python_v_3.8.2.txt: Python version used.
•	user_guide.txt: Contains detailed instructions and guides.


2. User interface
•	open: Loads the cleaned data into the application.
•	--select--: Columns can be selected from the dropdown menu below.
•	Chart Display Area: Where the charts will be displayed.
•	rename column: Renames selected column with text entered in user input. 
•	check empty value: Checks empty value in the data set.
•	drop null rows: Drops rows with null values.
•	mean: Calculates mean.
•	median: Calculates median.
•	min: Returns minimum value.
•	max: Returns maximum value.
•	data shape: Returns number of columns and rows in data set.
•	columns: Returns the columns in data set as a list.
•	drop column: Drops selected column.
•	standard deviation: Calculates the standard deviation.
•	histogram: Plots the most suitable plot for the selected column.
•	pie chart: Plots a pie chart for the selected column.
•	check punctuations: Checks if there are any punctuations in data set.
•	clear output: Clears user output.
•	drop duplicate rows: Drops duplicate rows.
•	check duplicates: Checks for duplicate rows.
•	user input: Right above the rename button, accepts input from user.
•	user output: Display output to user.


3. Usage

The app is best used in full screen mode.
Once the project folder is opened, the application can be run by running main.py file.
•	The open button is clicked to load the file. The opened file name will appear and file opened printed to output.
•	Preferred column is selected and actions can be performed on selected column from some button described above.
•	If file is not opened, prints message to the output for file to be opened.
•	If action can not be performed on selected column, message is printed to the output to select another column.
•	Column can be renamed by inserting text (15 characters maximum) into the input above rename button and then click the rename button.
•	Charts can be plotted be selecting the appropriate column and then click histogram or pie chart button.
